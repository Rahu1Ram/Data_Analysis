📘 Python Libraries for Data Analysis & Visualization
----
----
This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to Python libraries used in data analysis and data visualization. It covers both theoretical concepts and practical implementations to build a strong foundation.

🧮 NumPy
---
NumPy is a core Python library used for numerical computations and array-based operations.

Topics Covered:

1. In-built functions in NumPy

2. Array indexing and slicing

3. Operations on NumPy arrays

🐼 Pandas
---
Pandas is a powerful library used for data manipulation and analysis with Series and DataFrames.

Topics Covered:

1. Series

2. DataFrame

3. Indexing            

4. Reading files (CSV, Excel, etc.)     

5. In-built DataFrame functions      

6. File conversion       

7. Slicing in DataFrame    

8. loc VS iloc      

9. Boolean filtering

10. Data cleaning techniques

11. GroupBy operations  

12. Concatenation of DataFrames      

13. Joins and merge operations

14. Pivot tables

15. Aggregation functions

16. Date range functions

17. to_datetime() function



📊 Matplotlib
---
Matplotlib is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Topics Covered:

1. Line plot

2. Scatter plot

3. Histogram

4. Pie chart

5. Donut pie chart

6. Subplots

7. Figure object

🎨 Seaborn
----
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and is used for statistical data visualization.

Topics Covered:

1. distributoion plots
   
    1.1 dis/hist plot()
   
    1.2 joint plot()
   
    1.3 pair plot()

2. categorical plots

    2.1 count plot()
   
    2.2 bar plot()
   
    2.3 scatter plot()
   
    2.4 box plot()
   
    2.5 violin plot()

3. matrix plot

    - heatmap()

4. regression plot

    - lmplot()
